University Course Registration System

This repository contains the implementation of a university course registration system that applies fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows students to register for courses, view grades, calculate GPA, and file complaints. It also enables professors and administrators to manage courses, grades, and complaints.
Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three key sections:

    **Assignment PDF**
    This folder contains the original problem statement and assignment guidelines.

    **Solution Folder**
    The solution folder houses the complete Java-based project implementation of the university system. It includes classes like Student, Professor, Admin, Course, and others, utilizing OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance,    po     polymorphism, and abstraction.

    **Requirement Analysis Folder**
    This folder outlines the initial system requirements and contains the UML diagrams, high-level design decisions, and system architecture documentation. It provides insight into the thought process behind the design and implementation.
